# Lab 2 for MTH 420

In this directory, the code for lab1 is located in `lab2.py`. It is sectioned into different functions named `prob#`, and with other functions named according to the lab instructions. 

Other files per the instructions include `shut_the_box.py` and `calculator.py`.

*Notably*, the first problem is re-used for the third, so the printout may be slightly confusing at first.

### To run the code
With Python3 (and the Numpy module) installed, execute `python3 lab2.py` to run this assignment. Python3 should also be used to run the shut the box code too. Please email me at blochp@oregonstate.edu if you have any questions.
