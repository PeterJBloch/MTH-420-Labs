# Lab 1 for MTH 420

In this directory, the code for lab1 is located in `python_intro.py`. It is sectioned into different funcitons of the form 'prob#' with other functions named according to the lab instructions. 

Notably, the first problem is re-used for the third, so the printout may be slightly confusing at first.

### To Run
With Python3 (and the Numpy module) installed, execute `python3 python_intro.py` to run this assignment. Please email me at blochp@oregonstate.edu if you have any questions.
